# Create-maps
Create maps to explore the spatial-temporal distribution of ASVs and taxonomic groups. 

This is the R code that was used to produce the maps in my thesis. The input is a phyloseq object. The otu table in the phyloseq object is used to create clr-transformed values for each ASV and each of taxonomic groups at higher taxonomy levels. The clr-values are then used to produce maps for each expedition and size fraction.
